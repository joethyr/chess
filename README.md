# Chess: Ruby Final Project

Build a command line Chess game where two players can play against each other.

## Description

The final project on the Ruby Programming section of The Odin Project consists of building a chess program that is playable on the command line with two players.The program must be properly constrained so that it prevents players from making invalid moves. The program should also have the ability to save progress at any point in the game. Remember to use your problem solving skills such as pseudocode and divide and conquer to help you through this project.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

* Access program folder through the command line
* Enter code below:
```
ruby lib/main.rb
```
### How to Play

* A chessboard is made up of 64 squares placed in eight rows and eight columns.
* Starting top to bottom, each row is numbered [0-7].
* Starting left to right, each column is numbered [0-7]
* When prompted to move a chess piece, target a piece on any square by entering in the coordinates as so: (_row_, _column_) (omit parenthesis)
